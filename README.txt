Python scripts to simulate (using high-performance, parallel computing) a model of altitudinal biodiversity gradients.

The model is event-based and stochastic. It combines two disparate theories, based on metabolism and probability (the Metabolic Theory of Ecology and Neutral Biodiversity Theory).
